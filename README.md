# Protocol Buffers, Objective C

An implementation of Protocol Buffers in Objective C.

Protocol Buffers are a way of encoding structured data in an efficient yet extensible format.
This project is based on an implementation of Protocol Buffers from Google.  See the
[Google protobuf project][g-protobuf] for more information.

[g-protobuf]: http://code.google.com/p/protobuf/

## Cocoa Pods Support

In testing for Cocoa Pods. It's not been submitted to the central repo yet.

## Plug 'n Play

* added pre-compiled binaries for protoc and protoc-gen-obj
* added universal binary
* added ARC support for generated models
* added NSCoding and NSCopying to store directly to disk or keychain
* compiled with maverick

Add the ProtocolBuffers.framework to your project. The library will work for iOS Simulator and iOS 7.0 on iPhone 4,4s,5,5s.  

To generate protocol buffers model, create a .proto file, in terminal navigate to the `bin/protobuf/2.5.0/bin` directory and run `protoc --objc_out=./ <your_folder_with_.protofiles>`.

## Installation

1. Install XCode and XCode command line tools
2. Install brew
3. `brew install autogen`
4. `brew install aclocal`
5. `brew install automake`
6. `brew install protobuf`
6. Download source or clone repository to local machine
7. `cd` into root directory of project
8. `./autogen.sh`
9. `./configure`
10. `make -B -d & make install`

## Usage

`cd /folder/with/.proto files/ && protoc --objc_out=/my/output/folder *`

## Troubleshooting

Issue installing Protobufs 2.5.0 in Mavericks. Comment out the iosfwd.  

    #ifdef __DECCXX
    // HP C++'s iosfwd doesn't work.
    #include <iostream>
    #else
    #include <sstream>
    //#include <iosfwd> // comment out this for the sstream
    #endif

## File locations

    /usr/local/bin 
      protoc (file or symlink)
      protoc-gen-objc (file or symlink)
    /usr/local/include
      needs a symlink called "protobuf" to /usr/local/Cellar/protobuf/2.5.0/include
    /usr/local/opt
      needs a symlink called "protobuf" to /usr/local/Cellar/protobuf/2.5.0
